You need to use your assignment 3 for this assignment and use Firebase for login authentication/reviews for movies

Movie information must be downloaded from API

User credentials/profiles must be created/saved in Firebase

Users' reviews must be saved in Firebase and fetched into master/detail screens

Login Screen for login or regster / Profile Editing Screen
if successfully logged in, display the list of movies fetched from API
if successfully registered, display profile screen to add profile image and other information
profile image must be selected and uploaded intofirebase
if not selected, use default image for profile image
at least 3 more information in addition to profile image
if you use the same login/profile controller as mine, you will lose points

Master/Detail flow
Master View (TableView)
poster icon, title, # of reviews for each movie if they exist
Detail View (either TableView or CollectionView)
There must be multiple sections; for example, first section is for movie information from API and second section is for reviews from Firebase
Reviews can be written by multiple logged users
user name, review written by the user, # of like or dislike tapped by other users
review cell must be designed with at least
user name
review text
like/dislike buttons and number for each
review can be edited/deleted only by author
Navigation bar must show user information (profile icon and name)
when tapped, Profile Screen should be launched to edit
