Create TMDB account for Movie List App

You need to create an account for TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org) and get your own API key (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started).
You can load movie data information with your API key with the following urls:
Get Now Playing :    http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/now_playing?api_key=<<api_key>>
Get Popular         :    http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=<<api_key>>
Get Top Rated     :    http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=<<api_key>>
Get Upcoming     :    http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=<<api_key>>
Each movie entry has a field called “poster_path” or , which is where you should download the picture for the movies.
URI: http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/<<size>>/<<poster_path>>"; // size : "w92", "w154", "w185", "w342", "w500", "w780", or "original".
