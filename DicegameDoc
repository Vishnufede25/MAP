Develop an iOS Dice Game application.

The first screen must be your game
you don't need to do the same game as mine
You have to add outlets and actions connected to your screen and view controller
at least, game score and round # must be updated and displayed after each play
at least, start over (reset) and play buttons must have corresponding actions
must implement Alert Event Handling
waiting for the "alert dismissed"
example:

Add two more screens: one for game instruction and rules and another for author (you can reuse your first assignment)
use segue to connect screens
use dismiss method to go back 
design screens with the same theme as the main game screen
Use random number generator for rolled dice
Use multiple dice (>= 2)
the number is up to you (multiple image views)
you don't need to do the exact same game as I showed in the class
each rolled number (generated random number) must be shown with a corresponding image
Implement your own game rules for score
Your screen design is the matter!!!
Create your own Icon
Apply Auto Layout
must be shown in different screen size (X or SE)
